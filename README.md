ENCS3320-COMPUTER-NETWORKS-PROJECT-1
In this project, We have implemented TCP client-server applications using Go, Python, Java, and C. The server, set to specific port, 
adeptly manages broadcast messages sent every slot of time by seconds by clients, 
incorporating student names. The solution keeps track of the latest message from each client for easy reference. 
Furthermore, We have included a straightforward web server in Go, Python, Java, and C, 
all operating on specific port. This concise collection offers a glimpse into my network programming solutions across multiple languages.
